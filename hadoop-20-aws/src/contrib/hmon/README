This package implements a resource utilization monitoring daemon which run on
each of the TaskTrackers and a information collecting daemon called Collector
which collects and aggregates the resource utilization information submitted
from each monitoring daemons. 

This package allows us to query the real-time resource utilization information
(%CPU, %memory, maximum CPU, maximum memory, cumulated CPU cycles  etc.) of a
particular running Hadoop job or a particular TaskTracker. These information
will be available via the Collector RPC. The information can be used to
improve the efficiency and stability of scheduling tasks and to profile
Hadoop jobs.

The Collector can be run inside of JobTracker or as a separate daemon. Similarly
the UtilizationReporter can be run inside of TaskTracker or as a separate
daemon. (See RUNNIG)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUILDING:

In HADOOP_HOME, run ant package to build Hadoop and its contrib packages.
Copy build/contrib/hmon/hadoop-*-hmon.jar to build/lib/.
Copy src/bin/start-hmon.sh and src/bin/stop-hmon.sh to bin/.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIGURING:

The following properties can be set in conf/resourceutilization.xml to configure
this package. An example of resourceutilization.xml can be found in this
directory.

mapred.resourceutilization.server.address
  The address of the server which collects and aggregates the resource
  utilization information.

mapred.resourceutilization.handler.count
  The number of server threads of the Collector. This should be roughly ?% of
  the number of TaskTracker nodes.
  
mapred.resourceutilization.transmitperiod
  How often does a TaskTracker report to the Collector? (in millisecond)

mapred.resourceutilization.timelimit
  How long does a TaskTracker report expire? (in millisecond) This should be 1.5
  ~ 2 times of the transmitperiod.

mapred.resourceutilization.aggregateperiod
  How often do we aggregate the TaskTracker reports? (in millisecond). Shorter
  aggregateperiod provides newer data but requires more computation.  

mapred.resourceutilization.stoptimelimit
  How long do we consider a job is finished after it stops? (in millisecond).

mapred.resourceutilization.mirrorperiod
  How often do the CollectorMirrored mirror the information from Collector.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUNNING:

To start the resource collecting daemon, run the follwoing command on the Collector machine
assigned in mapred.resourceutilization.server.address. (See CONFIGURATION for
configuring the server.address)

$HADOOP_HOME/bin/start-hmon.sh

To stop the daemon, replace start in the above commands with stop:

$HADOOP_HOME/bin/stop-hmon.sh
