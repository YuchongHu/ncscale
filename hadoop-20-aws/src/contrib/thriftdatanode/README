                        Thrift API for HDFS Datanode
                        ============================

Introduction:
============

The Hadoop Distributed File System is written in Java. An application
that wants to store/fetch data to/from HDFS can use the Java API
This means that applications that are not written in Java cannot
access HDFS in an elegant manner.

Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services 
development. It combines a powerful software stack with a code generation 
engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly 
between C++, Java, Python, PHP, and Ruby.

This project exposes HDFS Datanode APIs using the Thrift software stack. This
allows applciations written in a myriad of languages to access
HDFS data elegantly.


The Application Programming Interface (API)
===========================================
The HDFS Datanode API that is exposed through Thrift can be found in if/hadoopdatanode.thrift.

Compilation
===========
The compilation process creates a server org.apache.hadoop.thriftfs.HadooopThriftDatanodeServer
that implements the Thrift interface defined in if/hadoopdatanode.thrift.

Th thrift compiler is used to generate API stubs in python, php, ruby,
cocoa, etc. The generated code is checked into the directories gen-*.
The generated java API is checked into lib/hadoopthriftdatanodeapi.jar.
